This tutorial is built to teach you ESMValTool. It starts from the basics, what it is, how it works, and goes to the advanced sections of how can I make my own diagnostics within ESMValTool and how do I contribute my code back to share with the ESMValTool community.

Don’t be alarmed if you can’t work through it all in one sitting. It may take some time to get used to working with ESMValTool.
