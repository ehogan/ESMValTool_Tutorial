This tutorial is built to teach you how to use ESMValTool.  

The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community developped software toolkit that aims to faciliate
the diagnosis and evaluation of the causes and effects of model biases and inter-model spread within the CMIP model
ensemble.

> ## Main things you need to know before starting this course
>
> 1. This tutorial can be taken online independently or taught by one of our instructors.
> 2. Please check the common issues page if you get stuck [Link to common issues page]. Otherwise, help is always available from ESMValTool developers via the github issues page.  
> 3. This tutorial includes several advanced lessons after the conclusion. These advanced lessons should be treated like “mini-tutorials”, and include aspects like “developing your own diagnostic” or “how to include observations”.
> 4. Don’t be alarmed if you can’t work through the entire tutorial in one sitting. It may take some time to get used to working with ESMValTool.
