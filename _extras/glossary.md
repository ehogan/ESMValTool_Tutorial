## ESMValTool Glossary

Here, there are some definitions used throughout this tutorial:

- **Diagnostics**:

- **CMIP**: The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) aims at better understanding past, present and future climate changes arising from natural, unforced variability or in response to changes in radiative forcing in a multi-model context. For more information, check the [WCR-Climate webpage](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/).

- **CMOR**: CMOR stands for [“Climate Model Output Rewriter” library](https://pcmdi.github.io/cmor-site/index.html). It comprises a set of C-based functions, with bindings to both Python and FORTRAN 90, that can be used to produce CF-compliant netCDF files that fulfill the requirements of many of the climate community's standard model experiments.

- **Recipe**: A recipe contains the instructions to be carried out by the ESMValTool. This includes four main sections: datasets, preprocessors, diagnostics and description.
