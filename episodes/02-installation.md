## Overview

In this tutorial we will be using the [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)
package manager to install the ESMValTool.
Other installation methods are also available, they can be found in the
[documentation](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html).
ESMValTool also contains diagnostics written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
Because Julia cannot be installed by Conda, we will install Julia separately.
We will first learn how to install Conda, Julia, and finally the ESMValTool.
We end this chapter by testing that the installation was successful.
